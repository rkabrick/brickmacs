;;; init-frontmacs.el -- Setup Emacs to initalize with Frontmacs
;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; Frontmacs provides a lot of nice customizations, but there needs
;;; to be a bootstrap process by which to actually get it
;;; running.  This is that bootstrap.  The idea is that you just need to
;;; load this script inside your `init.el` and it will take care of
;;; adding the frontside package archive to your package config, and
;;; then also installing it if it is not installed.
;;;
;;; --- init.el
;;;   ;; boot frontmacs
;;;   (load (expand-file-name "init-frontmacs.el" user-emacs-directory))
;;;
;;; In fact, it might need to be the only line you'll ever need in
;;; your init file.
;;; Code:


(load (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/brickmacs-pkg.el"))
(load (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/brickmacs-completion.el"))
(load (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/brickmacs-modeline.el"))
(load (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/brickmacs-theme.el"))
(load (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/brickmacs-editor.el"))

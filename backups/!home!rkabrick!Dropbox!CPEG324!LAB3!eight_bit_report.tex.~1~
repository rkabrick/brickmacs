\section{Abstract}
\label{sec:orgbfae8a4}
In this project we successfully implemented an 8-bit calculator in VHDL (Based on the included ISA PDF) using the following components:
\begin{itemize}
\item 8-bit Shift Register
\item Register File Containing 4 Shift Registers
\item 8-bit Adder/Subtractor
\item ALU
\item Datapath
\item Control Logic (Specifics are from the included slides)
\end{itemize}

\section{Division of Labor}
\label{sec:orgf107b77}
\textbf{Ryan}:
\begin{itemize}
\item 8-bit Add/Sub \& Testbench
\item Register file \& Testbench
\item Made report
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dawson}:
\begin{itemize}
\item ALU \& Testbench
\item Datapath \& Testbench
\item Control \& Testbench
\item RTL Diagrams \& Control Logic Diagrams
\end{itemize}

\section{Detailed Strategy}
\label{sec:org2b441b4}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create all components seperately
\item Implement testbenches for all of them immediately to ensure proper functioning as we progressed
\item Link components and conduct further testing
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overall Testbench Logic}
\label{sec:orga0e4140}
\begin{itemize}
\item We ended up scrapping our original testbench as we felt it necessary to test components more thoroughly and to add lines which aided in the debugging process
\item We included manipulation of registers with both positive and negative values
\item We tested the skip function both when it should skip and when it should not skip
\item We tested both add and subtraction functions
\item We tested the display function throughout the final testbench
\item We tested the load immediate functionality
\end{itemize}


\section{Results}
\label{sec:org4a29287}
\textbf{Add}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Successfully added the values of two registers and wrote to the destination register
\item Accurate overflow/underflow handling
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sub}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Successfully subtracted numbers and wrote to the destination register
\item Accurate overflow/underflow handling
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Skip}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Successfully skipped instructions after the comparison of two registers found they were equal
\item Successfully did not skip instructions after the comparison of two registers was found to be not equal
\end{itemize}

\textbf{LI}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Signed integers (4-bit) were able to be loaded to registers
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Print/Display}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Accurately displayed correct register data
\item Handled conversion from STD\(_{\text{LOGIC}}\)\(_{\text{VECTOR}}\) to signed integer value
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:orge364b52}
This project was the most difficult VHDL project we have taken on at this point in our academic career.
We had to make constant adjustments to our initial thoughts on implementation as we progressed and
realized our original idea would not provide for accurate communication between components.

We are very glad we provided testbenches for each component after writing it because it ensured we could
debug much more efficiently than if we only had a testbench for the final product.

Overall, we have learned so much from this project. Although this is just a simple 8-bit calculator, this
experience has opened our eyes to how more complex ISAs can be implemented; the planning before, the advantages
and disadvantages associated with designating the functionality of certain bits, along with many more
examples.
